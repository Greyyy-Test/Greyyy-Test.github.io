While LaMET has enabled significant progress in accessing parton physics from lattice QCD, several challenges remain. At the same time, new opportunities are emerging as computational and theoretical techniques advance.

## Main Challenges

### 1. Achieving Large Hadron Momenta

Lattice calculations require hadrons to be boosted to large momenta, but this is technically demanding due to discretization effects, signal-to-noise degradation, and finite volume artifacts.

### 2. Renormalization and Mixing

Nonlocal operators in LaMET are subject to ultraviolet divergences and operator mixing. Developing robust nonperturbative renormalization methods is an active area of research.

### 3. Control of Systematic Uncertainties

Systematic effects such as excited-state contamination, finite volume, and discretization errors must be carefully controlled to ensure reliable results.

### 4. Matching and Factorization

The matching between quasi-distributions and light-cone PDFs involves perturbative calculations and power corrections. Improving the precision of these steps is crucial for accurate phenomenology.

## Opportunities

- **Algorithmic Advances:** New algorithms and increased computational power are enabling calculations at higher momenta and with better control of systematics.
- **Broader Applications:** LaMET is being applied to a wider range of observables, including GPDs, TMDs, and more.
- **Synergy with Experiments:** Results from LaMET are increasingly relevant for interpreting data from current and future experiments, such as the EIC.

## Conclusion

LaMET continues to be a vibrant area of research, with ongoing efforts to overcome challenges and seize new opportunities in the study of hadron structure from first principles.
