This is the official webpage of **Large Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET)**, a theoretical framework that allows the calculation of parton physics from lattice QCD using hadron states with large momenta.

The webpage is deployed at [https://lamet4parton.org/](https://lamet4parton.org/).

## üìÑ Adding a New Page

To add a new page:
1. Copy the template file: `page_template.md` from the `_pages` directory.
2. Rename it (e.g., `my-new-page.md`) and edit the content as needed.
3. Place your new file in the `_pages` directory.
4. Add a navigation entry in `_data/navigation.yml` if you want it to appear in the sidebar or top menu.

**Example front matter for a new page:**
```yaml
---
title: "My New Page"
permalink: /my-new-page/
layout: single
toc: true           # Show table of contents (right sidebar)
toc_sticky: true    # Make TOC sticky while scrolling
sidebar:
  - title: "Welcome"
    image: /assets/images/lamet.png
    image_alt: "Profile Photo"
    text: "This is a custom sidebar block."
---
```

- `toc`: Show the "On this page" table of contents (right sidebar, auto-generated from headings)
- `toc_sticky`: Make the TOC sticky (remains visible while scrolling)
- `sidebar`: Custom left sidebar content (see Minimal Mistakes docs for more options)

For more advanced sidebar navigation, you can use:
```yaml
sidebar:
  nav: "main"  # or "docs", as defined in _data/navigation.yml
```

## üìù Adding a New Post

To add a new blog post:
1. Create a new file in the `_posts` directory, named as `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` (e.g., `2024-06-06-my-post.md`).
   - There is also a template: `2024-06-06-post-template.md` in `_posts`.
2. Use the following front matter:

```yaml
---
title: "My Post Title"
date: 2024-06-06
layout: single
toc: true
toc_sticky: true
author_profile: false
sidebar:
  nav: "main"
categories:
  - blog
tags:
  - LaMET
---
```

Write your post content below the front matter.
