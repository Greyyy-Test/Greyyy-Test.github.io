## What is LaMET?

Large Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET) is a theoretical framework that allows the calculation of parton physics from lattice QCD by boosting hadrons to large momenta.
{: .notice--info}

## Why is LaMET important?

LaMET provides a practical approach to access parton distribution functions (PDFs) and other light-cone correlations from first principles.

## What are the main challenges in LaMET calculations?

- Achieving large enough hadron momenta on the lattice
- Controlling power corrections and renormalization
- Matching and factorization
